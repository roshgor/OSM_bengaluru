Bengaluru City
Its the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. 
Population of over ten million. Third most populous city in India. 

Reason for choosing this area:
I have been working in Bangalore as a data engineer for the last two years, and the exploration
of the OSM data of my city sounded very interesting and fun.
